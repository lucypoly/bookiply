## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm eject` - exposes content of `react-script` package

- `npm lint` - lints project files according to eslint rules, see below. Typical use case: continuous integration environments, Travis, CircleCI, etc.

- `npm fix` - same as `npm lint`, but also fixes errors, when possible. Typical use case: local development environment, git hooks.
